# PLTP: An independent reproduction of the Boyer-Moore Pure Lisp Theorem Prover

A fully automatic inductive theorem prover for a logic based on Pure Lisp.
Modeled on the original Boyer-Moore prover presented in Moore's PhD, 1973.

# Why

The original Boyer-Moore Pure Lisp Theorem Prover is the "big bang" of the universe (multiverse!) of automated induction.

It's an incredible thrill to work through their original design and reproduce the proofs independently. J Moore's PhD thesis is written in a way that makes this possible. Sadly, most works in automated reasoning do not have this property. We should all strive to write more like J Moore and Bob Boyer.

PLTP represents many aspects of automated induction in their most essential form.
Studying PLTP is a great way to learn about simplification, induction schemes, generalisation, fertilisation, and the interplay between recursion and induction.

Did you know that PLTP could prove `(EQUAL (REV (REV x)) x)` fully automatically in 1973, without any lemmas?
